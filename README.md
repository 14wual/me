## Possible mistakes

### Command does not exist

Modify your rc file, either `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`

```
nano .zshrc
```

```bash
# Go to the last row and write the following
alias me='sudo python3 /usr/local/etc/me/pip/app/me/me/__init__.py'
```

### NoSectionError

Modify the content of the following file: `/home/example/.config/me/bin/me/me.ini`, changing the data for your information.
Don't forget to modify the paths.

File content:

```ini
[me]
version = 0.1 
user = <your-user> 
password = <your-password>

[software]
browser = default
mail = <your-mail@gmail.com>

[databases]
password = /usr/local/etc/me/local/share/database/password.db
browser = /usr/local/etc/me/usr/browser/log/favorites.csv
notes = /usr/local/etc/me/usr/txt/log/notes_inputs.csv
```

### Why does it ask me for sudo?

Due to the path where the program is located (it is in a common path in all operating systems and is there to create the fewest possible incompatibilities) it is necessary to ask for root. Since many of the functionalities write files inside the subpaths. Path `/usr/local/etc/me/`
